# food-order-chatbot


The food delivery chatbot project showcases a seamless user experience through its intuitive interface and efficient functionality. Upon interaction, the chatbot utilizes Dialogflow's natural language processing to accurately interpret user requests, guiding them through the food ordering process with ease. Leveraging its backend built with Python and Fastapi, the chatbot seamlessly communicates with a MySQL database, allowing users to browse menus, place orders, and receive real-time updates on their delivery status. This demonstration highlights the project's ability to streamline the food delivery process while providing a user-friendly and engaging experience.
